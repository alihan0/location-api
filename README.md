# Install
Run the following command to install the library. This command will download your files.
```
git clone https://github.com/alihan0/location-api .
```

Then run this command for libraries and dependencies. This command will create a `node_modules` folder in the directory.
```
npm install
```

Finally, you can start the node. Use this command for this action.
